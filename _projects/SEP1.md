## Project Overview

As part of our university's Systems Engineering Project 1 module, our team applied the SEBoK systems approach to design and implement an autonomous navigation system. 
We built a 1.5m x 1.33m arena themed after Singapore Changi Airportâ€™s Jewel Mastercard Bridge, featuring various navigation plots and a custom ramp structure. A LIMO robot was used to navigate the arena autonomously using ROS1 Melodic, the Navigation Stack, and RTAB-Map for real-time SLAM and mapping.
