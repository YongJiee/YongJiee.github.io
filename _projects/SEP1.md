## Project Overview

This project involved developing an autonomous navigation system for the LIMO robot using ROS1, completed as part of a six-member team for the Systems Engineering Project 1 module. The goal was to enable the robot to explore, localize, and navigate through indoor environments using real-time SLAM and path planning. We integrated RTAB-Map for mapping and localization, configured the ROS navigation stack, and tuned the system to handle tight corridors and uneven terrain such as slopes and bridges. The project emphasized collaborative development, system integration, and real-world testing to create a robust mobile robotics solution.
