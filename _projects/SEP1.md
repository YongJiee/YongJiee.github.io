## Project Overview

As part of our university's Systems Engineering Project 1 module, our team applied the SEBoK systems approach to design and implement an autonomous navigation system. 
We built a 1.5m x 1.33m arena themed after Singapore Changi Airportâ€™s Jewel Mastercard Bridge, featuring various navigation plots and a custom ramp structure. A LIMO robot was used to navigate the arena autonomously using **ROS1 Melodic**, the **Navigation Stack**, and **RTAB-Map** for real-time **SLAM** and mapping.

Check out the full program on [GitHub](https://github.com/YongJiee/Systems-Engineering-Project-1-Group-6.git).

### Final Demonstration Video
This video showcases the LIMO robot performing full autonomous navigation in a custom-built indoor arena inspired by Changi Airport's Canopy Park. The robot uses **RTAB-Map** for real-time SLAM, along with the **ROS1 Navigation Stack** for path planning, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic recovery.
