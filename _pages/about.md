I am Yong Jie. Currently pursuing a degree in Robotics Systems (RSE) at Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and will be graduating in 2028.

I've been exposed to robotics since I was 13 years old, and my interest has grown over the years. At secondary school, I joined the school's Robotics Club and competed in both local and international competitions, winning numerous first-place awards. After secondary school, I studied Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering at ITE (Higher Nitec) and Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP), where I became interested in robotics automation and Programmable  Logic Controller (PLC). In addition, throughout my time at ITE and NYP, I competed in multiple WorldSkills in mechatronics and received a medallion of excellence.
