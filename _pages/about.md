I am Yong Jie.Currently pursuing a degree in Robotics Systems (RSE) at Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT) and will graduate in 2028.

I've been exposed to robotics since I was 13 years old, and my interest has grown. During my secondary school years, I joined the Robotics Club and competed in both local and international competitions, winning numerous first-place awards. After secondary school, I studied Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering at ITE (Higher Nitec) and NYP, where I became interested in robotics automation and PLC. In addition, throughout my ITE and NYP, I competed in WorldSkills in mechatronics and received a medallion of excellence.
