## Competition Achievements

I competed in **WorldSkills Singapore Mechatronics** from 2018-2021, earning **Medallions of Excellence** in 2020 and 2021. WorldSkills is an international competition often called the "Olympics of Skills," where two-person teams design, build, and program complete industrial automation systems under strict time and quality requirements.

### Awards & Recognition
- **Medallion of Excellence** - 2020, 2021
- **Years Competed:** 2018, 2020, 2021
- **Competition Type:** Team-based (2 members), multi-day intensive challenges
